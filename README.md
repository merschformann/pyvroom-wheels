# pyvroom-wheels

This project provides wheels for the [Pyvroom](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/pyvroom) project for further platforms (including the linux-arm64 platform built on an RPi <img src="material/rpi-logo.png" height="20" /> with ❤️).

## Usage

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install pyvroomwheels
```

Continue using the package as you would with the original package:

```python
import pyvroom
```

Refer to the original [basic usage](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/pyvroom?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage) for more information.

## Remarks

We are grateful to the [VROOM Project](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom) for their amazing work and for providing the [pyvroom](https://pypi.org/project/pyvroom/) package.

This project is merely a stopgap solution for having linux-arm64 wheels available. All credit goes to the original authors.
