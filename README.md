# pyvroom-wheels

This project provides wheels for the [Pyvroom](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/pyvroom) project on the linux-arm64 platform built on an RPi <img src="material/rpi-logo.png" height="20" /> with ❤️.

## Usage

The wheels can be directly included as a dependency in your project. For example, in your `requirements.txt` file:

```txt
pyvroom@https://github.com/merschformann/pyvroom-wheels/releases/download/1.13.4/pyvroom-1.13.4-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl
```

## Remarks

We are grateful to the [VROOM Project](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom) for their amazing work and for providing the [pyvroom](https://pypi.org/project/pyvroom/) package.

This project is merely a stopgap solution for having linux-arm64 wheels available. All credit goes to the original authors.
