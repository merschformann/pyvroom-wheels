## Remarks

We are grateful to the [VROOM Project](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom) for their amazing work and for providing the [pyvroom](https://pypi.org/project/pyvroom/) package.

This project is merely a stopgap solution for having the pyvroom package conveniently available on further platforms. All credit goes to the original authors.
